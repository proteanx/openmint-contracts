# Open Mint - Contracts

This repository contains the solidity contracts for the Open Mint project V1. This entire project including the interface is open source (MIT) and contributions are welcome. For feature requests please submit an issue.

The idea behind Open Mint is to build ERC20 minting structure open to the public similar to how BRC20 & Runes tokens are minted on bitcoin. There is a set amount per mint and a maximum amount of mints, as well as a start and end block. Use at your own risk, this is presented without warranty.

V2 will have many additional features including automatic LP generation from mint fees, optional mint limits per account and anything else I can think of (suggestions are welcome). V2 will have a react UI option as well as a Frame option for use on Farcaster. This work is already in progress.
